# Azure Deployment - Ready to Go! âœ…

## Summary

**YES**, your CodeJudge project is **100% ready for Azure deployment** with your Azure Student account!

## What I Created for You

1. **`AZURE_QUICKSTART.md`** - Fast deployment guide (recommended to start here)
2. **`AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive deployment documentation with 3 options
3. **`deploy-azure.ps1`** - Automated deployment script

## Fastest Way to Deploy (5 minutes setup)

```powershell
# 1. Login to Azure
az login

# 2. Deploy everything
.\deploy-azure.ps1 -DeploymentType aci

# 3. Wait ~20 minutes, then access your app!
```

## What Gets Deployed

- âœ… Your monolith service (web app with all features)
- âœ… PostgreSQL 14 database (fully managed)
- âœ… Redis cache (fully managed)
- âœ… Dark/light theme toggle (working!)
- âœ… All authentication features
- âœ… Problem creation and submissions
- âœ… Plagiarism detection

## Cost with Azure Student Account

- **Total**: ~$45-55/month
- **Your Credits**: $100 free
- **Runtime**: **2+ months completely free!**

After your credits run out, you can:
- Switch to free tier services
- Delete resources to stop charges
- Upgrade if you want to continue

## Three Deployment Options

### 1. Container Instances (Recommended for Students)
- Simplest to set up
- ~$45/month
- Perfect for testing and low traffic
- **Deploy with**: `.\deploy-azure.ps1 -DeploymentType aci`

### 2. App Service (Best for Production)
- Auto-scaling
- Built-in SSL/HTTPS
- Custom domains
- ~$55/month
- **Deploy with**: `.\deploy-azure.ps1 -DeploymentType appservice`

### 3. Kubernetes (AKS)
- Enterprise-grade
- Microservices architecture
- ~$75/month
- Manual setup (see AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Judge Service Note

The C++ judge service requires privileged Docker access for sandboxing. For Azure deployment, you have two options:

**Option A (Recommended)**: Hybrid approach
- Web app on Azure (accessible worldwide)
- Judge service running locally (secure execution)
- Connected via Redis queue

**Option B**: Deploy judge to AKS with security context (advanced)

## Your Project Structure

Your project already has everything needed:
- âœ… Dockerfiles configured
- âœ… docker-compose.yml for local testing
- âœ… Environment variables documented
- âœ… Health checks implemented
- âœ… Graceful shutdown handling
- âœ… Database migrations ready
- âœ… Redis queue integration

## Quick Commands Reference

### Deploy
```powershell
.\deploy-azure.ps1 -DeploymentType aci
```

### View Logs
```powershell
az container logs --resource-group codejudge-rg --name [APP-NAME] --follow
```

### Check Costs
```powershell
az consumption usage list --query "[].{Date:usageStart, Cost:pretaxCost}" -o table
```

### Delete Everything (Stop All Costs)
```powershell
az group delete --name codejudge-rg --yes --no-wait
```

## Files to Read

1. **Start here**: `AZURE_QUICKSTART.md` - Get up and running in 5 minutes
2. **Detailed guide**: `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - All deployment options explained
3. **Reference**: `.env.example` - Environment variables documentation

## What to Do Now

1. **Install Azure CLI** (if not already):
   ```powershell
   winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI
   ```

2. **Run the deployment**:
   ```powershell
   az login
   .\deploy-azure.ps1
   ```

3. **Wait ~20 minutes** (Azure provisions resources)

4. **Access your app** at the URL provided

5. **Set up budget alerts** in Azure Portal to monitor spending

## Monitoring Your Deployment

After deployment, you'll get a `azure-deployment-config.txt` file with all your credentials and URLs. **Keep this file safe!**

It contains:
- Database connection string
- Redis connection string
- JWT secret
- Application URL
- All resource names

## Budget Protection

To avoid surprise charges:

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to "Cost Management + Billing"
3. Create a budget alert for $80 (to warn you before hitting $100)
4. Set up email notifications

## Current Features Working

âœ… User authentication (register/login/JWT)
âœ… Problem creation and listing
âœ… Code submission system
âœ… Plagiarism detection
âœ… Dark/light theme toggle
âœ… Modern brutalist UI design
âœ… Reduced header spacing
âœ… Soft black colors (#1a1a1a, #0a0a0a)
âœ… Responsive design
âœ… KaTeX math rendering

## Production Checklist

Before going live with real users:

- [ ] Change JWT_SECRET to strong random value (script generates one)
- [ ] Set up custom domain (if using App Service)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL (automatic with App Service)
- [ ] Set up backup strategy for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Configure Redis persistence
- [ ] Set up Application Insights for monitoring
- [ ] Create admin user account
- [ ] Test all features end-to-end
