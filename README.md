# CodeJudge: High-Performance Online Judging System

CodeJudge is a cloud-native backend for powering competitive programming and automated code evaluation platforms. It is built on a distributed microservices architecture using Go and C++ for high throughput, scalability, and security.

## Key Features

- **Secure C++ Sandbox:** Leverages `fork`, `exec`, and `setrlimit` for low-level process isolation and resource management, preventing malicious code execution.
- **Horizontally Scalable:** Go and C++ services are decoupled via a Redis message bus, allowing for independent scaling of workers and other components.
- **Algorithmic Plagiarism Detection:** Implements a shingling and winnowing pipeline to detect structural code similarity, moving beyond simple token matching.
- **Dockerized & Cloud-Native:** Fully containerized with `docker-compose.yml` for local development, plus Kubernetes manifests for cluster deployment.

## Microservices Overview

| Service                  | Language | Path                   | Role                                 |
|--------------------------|----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **API Gateway**          | Go       | `api-gateway/`         | HTTP API entrypoint, routing, static UI |
| **Problems Service**     | Go       | `problems-service-go/` | Problem CRUD, metadata, DB access    |
| **Submissions Service**  | Go       | `submissions-service-go/` | Handles code submissions, job queue |
| **Plagiarism Service**   | Go       | `plagiarism-service-go/` | Plagiarism detection pipeline      |
| **Judge Service**        | C++      | `judge-service/`       | Secure code execution, sandboxing    |
| **Database**             | Postgres | Docker/K8s             | Primary datastore                    |
| **Message Queue**        | Redis    | Docker/K8s             | Job queue & message bus              |

## Technology Stack

| Component         | Technology                | Role                                 |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Backend Services  | Go (net/http, go-redis)  | API, orchestration, business logic   |
| Judge Engine      | C++17                    | Sandboxed code execution             |
| Database          | PostgreSQL               | Persistent storage                   |
| Message Queue     | Redis                    | Job queue, pub/sub                   |
| Containerization  | Docker, Docker Compose   | Local deployment                     |
| Infrastructure    | Kubernetes               | Cluster deployment & provisioning    |

## Quickstart (Docker Compose)

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose

1. **Clone & Enter Project:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kwant-dbg/CodeJudge.git
   cd CodeJudge
   ```
2. **Launch All Services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
   The API Gateway is exposed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Advanced Deployment

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes manifests for core services are in `kubernetes/deploy/`.

To deploy (example):
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deploy/
```

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes manifests for core services are in `kubernetes/deploy/`.
Apply them to any compatible cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deploy/
```

## Local Development & Testing

- All Go services are in their respective folders and can be run or tested independently.
- The C++ judge service can be built and run in isolation for sandbox testing.
- Use `docker-compose` for full integration testing.
- Maven tasks (if present) can be run with:
  ```powershell
  mvn -B verify
  mvn -B test
  ```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/api/problems/` | Retrieve all problems. |
| `POST`| `/api/problems/` | Create a new problem. |
| `POST`| `/api/submissions`| Enqueue a new code submission for judging. |
| `GET` | `/api/plagiarism/reports` | Get plagiarism analysis reports. |


**Example Submission:** `POST /api/submissions`
```json
{
  "problem_id": 1,
  "language": "cpp",
  "source_code": "#include <iostream>\nint main() { int a, b; std::cin >> a >> b; std::cout << a + b << std::endl; return 0; }"
}
```
